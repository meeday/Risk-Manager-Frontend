## Description
This is a risk management application, created for use on engineering projects.

Users can create a project (with a title, description, location) and can create risks associated with their project. 
Risks are given a likelihood and severity score which is used to calculate the overall risk score.
Users can comment on risks and can see comments left by other users.
Risks can be viewed on a map and are colour coded depending on their risk score.
Registration and login is required to use the application.

The application was created using a MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js).
This repository is for the front end application and is deployed to Firebase.
The backend repository is accessible at https://github.com/JoeDodgson/Risk-Manager-Backend and is deployed to Heroku.
